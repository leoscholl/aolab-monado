## Monado 24.0.0 (2024-06-07)

This is a substantial release, our first tagged release in three years. In that
intervening period, most Monado users have been using the `main` development
branch directly. We intend to release more regularly going forward, with very
limited backports of fixes to stable branches as needed.

Compared to 21.0.0, this release features, among many other changes,
substantially improved OpenXR conformance, support for additional extensions as
well as initial support for OpenXR 1.1 (intended to be conformant but not yet
submitted), asynchronous time warp in both the graphics-pipeline and
compute-pipeline compositors, equal composition layer support in both compositor
pipelines, improved multi-platform capabilities, optical hand tracking in some
environments, support for external visual-inertial tracking (VIT aka SLAM)
modules, and many driver additions and improvements. The maintainers would like
to express our gratitude to the Monado community for their collective efforts,
submission of merge requests and issues, mutual support, derived runtimes, and
documentation efforts on top of Monado over the past three years. We look
forward to keeping the momentum up!

- Major changes
  - Implement OpenXR 1.1
    ([!2194](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2194))
  - Added WinMR driver, it supports most headsets and controllers. Controllers can
    be connected both via host-Bluetooth and tunneled with the onboard radio chip.
    By default has 3DoF tracking, it can do 6DoF if used with the Basalt SLAM
    tracking software. Distortion is there but doesn't work perfectly on all
    hardware, best results is on Reverb G2.

    [!1859](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1859))
  - New compute-shader based rendering backend in the compositor. Supports
    projection, quad, equirect2, cylinder layers. It is not enabled by default.
    It also supports ATW. On some hardware the use of a compute queue improves
    latency when pre-empting other GPU work.
    ([!873](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/873),

    [!2001](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2001))
  - Added [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) as a supported tracing
    backend, it joins the [Perfetto](https://perfetto.dev/) backend. Tracy works
    on Windows, but doesn't support full system tracing or multi app as well as
    Perfetto.

    [!1827](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1827))
  - Add driver for XREAL (formerly nreal) Air glasses, the device features 3dof
    tracking. Also support XREAL Air 2 and XREAL Air 2 Pro.
    ([!1798](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1798),

    [!2172](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2172))
  - xrt: Updates binding verify usage for new binding code gen and pass in enabled
    extensions status.
    ([!1896](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1896))
  - Add `libmonado` library, allows control of applications and devices. Exposed
    API follows semver and is semi-stable. Will never be changed in a backward
    incompatible way without increasing the major version. Provisions for easily
    and safely checking version is included, both at compile and runtime.
    ([!1908](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1908),
    [!2055](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2055),
    [!2099](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2099))
  - Add driver for Rokid and Rokid Max glasses, the devices features 3dof tracking.
    ([!1930](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1930))
  - Add new curated debug GUI, while not exposing all the of the knobs it presents
    those knobs in a more organized way compared to the advanced UI. The curated UI
    also features the readback sink in the background, making it possible for it
    to double as the peek window.
    ([!1941](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1941))
  - Graphics compositor: Add new graphics layer helper code, supports projection,
    quad, cylinder, and equirect2 layers. This path now completely replaces the old
    layer renderer that was in the main compositor, making it reusable.
    ([!1983](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1983),
    [!1994](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1994),

    [!2026](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2026),
    [!2105](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2105))
  - Add hot-switch support for input devices like controllers and gamepads. This is
    not full hot-plug support, but instead only enables switching between devices
    created at start.
    ([!1992](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1992))
  - Add framework support for face tracking xrt-devices. XR_HTC_facial_tracking
    being the first face tracking extension supported and the conventions of this
    for expression weights that xrt-device/drivers can output.
    More will be added in the future.
    ([!2163](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2163),
    [!2166](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2166),
    [!2218](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2218))
  - Add body tracking xrt-devices framework and support for the XR_FB_body_tracking
    extension.
    ([!2178](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2178))
  - Implement experimental XR_MNDX_xdev_space extension
    ([!2211](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2211),
    [!2215](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2215))
- XRT Interface
  - Added frame timing code that when the underlying vulkan driver supports the
    VK_GOOGLE_display_timing extension greatly improves the timing accuracy of
    the compositor. Along with this tracing code was added to better help use
    understand what was happening during a frame.
    ([!697](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/697))
  - Add functionality to disable individual drivers in the configuration file.
    ([!704](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/704))
  - Return `xrt_result_t` from `xrt_gfx_provider_create_gl_egl`.
    ([!705](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/705))
  - Add `XRT_ERROR_EGL_CONFIG_MISSING` error, to handle missing config from EGL
    compositor creation call.
    ([!705](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/705),
    [!768](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/768))
  - Add small helper function for pushing frames.
    ([!715](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/715))
  - Add `xrt_compositor_fence` interface to handle service and client render
    synchronisation.
    ([!721](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/721))
  - Add `XRT_ERROR_THREADING_INIT_FAILURE` a new threading related error code.
    ([!721](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/721))
  - Add alternative functions to `xrt_compositor::wait_frame` called
    `xrt_compositor::predict_frame` and `xrt_compositor::mark_frame` these allow
    one to do frame timing without having to block on the service side.
    ([!721](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/721))
  - Add `xrt_multi_compositor_control` that allows the `xrt_system_compositor` to
    expose a interface that the IPC layer can use to manage multiple clients
    without having to do the rendering. This allows us to move a lot of the code
    out the IPC layer and make it more about passing calls.
    ([!721](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/721))
  - Pass `XrFrameEndInfo::displayTime` to `xrt_compositor::layer_begin` so that the
    compositor can correctly schedule frames, most importantly do not display them
    too early that might lead to stutter.
    ([!721](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/721))
  - Make `xrt_swapchain` be reference counted. This will greatly help with
    handling swapchains for multiple clients in the compositor rendering pipeline
    where a client might go away while the compositor is using it.
    ([!723](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/723),
    [!754](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/754),
    [!807](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/807))
  - Make `enum xrt_blend_mode` an array instead of a bitfield, so that drivers can
    specify which one is preferred.
    ([!749](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/749))
  - Add new IPC session not created error `XRT_ERROR_IPC_SESSION_NOT_CREATED`, as
    some functions cannot be called without first creating a session.
    ([!768](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/768))
  - Make eye_relation argument to xrt_device_get_view_pose const, more safety for
    everybody.
    ([!794](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/794))
  - Add `XRT_ERROR_IPC_SESSION_ALREADY_CREATED` error message to signal that a
    session has already been created on this connection.
    ([!800](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/800))
  - Add a conventions page.
    ([!810](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/810),
    [#61](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/issues/61))
  - Send down sub-image offsets and sizes in normalised form, this makes it so that
    compositor does not need to track the size of swapchains.
    ([!847](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/847))
  - Add `use_dedicated_allocation` field to `xrt_image_native` struct to track if
    dedicated allocation is required.
    ([!867](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/867))
  - Add xrt_vec3_f64 struct.
    ([!870](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/870))
  - Make `xrt_system_compositor_info::supported_blend_modes` an array with an
    adjacent count field.
    ([!975](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/975))
  - Rename all `num_` parameters and fields in the interface, typically to `_count`
    but sometimes `_capacity`, to match OpenXR convention.
    ([!977](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/977))
  - Remove `xrt_view::display::{w|h}_meters`, they are not used anywhere.
    ([!1054](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1054))
  - Rename `xrt_space_graph` (and related `m_space_graph_*` functions in
    `m_space.h`) to `xrt_relation_chain` to more accurately reflect the function of
    this structure.
    ([!1092](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1092))
  - Add the ability for `xrt_device` to dynamically change the fov of the views
    return back to the applications. We do this by addning a new function called
    `xrt_device::get_view_poses` and removing the old one. This function now
    returns view poses, fovs and the observer position in one go.
    ([!1105](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1105))
  - Add `XRT_TIMEOUT` to be used for operations that can timeout, same value as
    `VK_TIMEOUT` for extra compatibility.
    ([!1147](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1147))
  - Make it possible when creating the Vulkan client compositor to say if timeline
    semaphores has been enabled.
    ([!1164](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1164))
  - Add `xrt_compositor_semaphore` object, add interfaces to `xrt_compositor` for
    creating the new semaphore object. Also add interface for passing in semaphore
    to `xrt_compositor::layer_commit`. Added support for these interface through
    the whole Monado stack.
    ([!1164](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1164))
  - Add `XRT_CHECK_RESULT` define to be used for ensure that the result from
    functions are read and acted upon.
    ([!1166](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1166))
  - xrt: Add new `XRT_TRACING` environmental variable to control if tracing is
    enabled or not, this is to work around crashes in Perfetto when running the
    CTS.
    ([!1231](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1231))
  - Introduce `xrt_uuid_t` and `xrt_luid_t` structs and add these as field to
    `xrt_system_compositor_info` to more correctly transport UUID and LUID values.
    ([!1250](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1250),
    [!1257](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1257),
    [!1259](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1259))
  - xrt: Add xrt_swapchain_create_properties to allow client compositors and IPC
    code to query the main compositor how many images to create on a swapchain,
    and provide an extension point for more properties as needed.
    ([!1258](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1258))
  - Introduce `xrt_system_devices` struct and `xrt_instance_create_system` call.
    This is a prerequisite for builders, also has the added benefit of moving the
    logic of which devices has which role solely into the service/instance.
    ([!1275](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1275),
    [!1279](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1279),

    [!1299](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1299))
  - Introduce `xrt_builder` struct and various functions on `xrt_prober`
    to support them. This is a follow up on the `xrt_system_devices` changes.
    These make it much easier to build more complex integrated systems like WinMR
    and Rift-S, and moves a lot of contextual configuration out of generic drivers
    like the hand-tracker code needing to know which device it was being used by.
    ([!1285](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1285),
    [!1299](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1299),
    [!1313](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1313))
  - Make an `xrt_builder` specifically for Lighthouse (vive, index, etc.), and
    remove Lighthouse devices from the legacy builder.
    ([!1296](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1296))
  - No longer include any util headers (in this case `u_time.h`), the XRT headers
    are supposed to be completely self contained. The include also messed with
    build
    refactoring in the auxiliary directory.
    ([!1328](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1328))
  - Mark haptic value in xrt_device_set_output as const.
    ([!1408](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1408))
  - Remove unused `xrt_layer_cube_data::image_array_index` field.
    ([!1421](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1421))
  - Add a single header for limits, like max number of swapchain images.
    ([!1553](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1553))
  - Add `XRT_IPC_SERVICE_PID_FILE_NAME` cmake variable to configure the name of pid
    file.
    ([!1567](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1567))
  - Add `XRT_OXR_RUNTIME_SUFFIX` cmake variable to configure the suffix of the
    output openXR library.
    ([!1567](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1567))
  - Remove the `xrt_gfx_native.h` as it is no longer needed, it has been replaced
    by `compositor/main` own interface file. In the past it was the state tracker
    or IPC layer that created the `xrt_system_compositor` directly by calling this
    function. But now it's the `xrt_instance`s responsibility, and it can pick
    which compositor to create. So this interface becomes less special and just
    one of many possible compositors implementations.
    ([!1569](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1569))
  - Added `XRT_STRUCT_INIT` define to help with headers and code that needs to
    compile as both C and C++ code. This is due to differences in default struct
    initialization.
    ([!1578](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1578))
  - Document using `XRT_INPUT_GENERIC_UNBOUNDED_SPACE_POSE` unbounded reference
    space.
    ([!1621](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1621))
  - Remote `xrt_prober_device::product_name` array, the value was only used
    internally by the prober. There is already a access function for the product
    name that is needed by USB, so make the interface less confusing.
    ([!1732](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1732))
  - Added functions to swapchain to explicitly do the barrier insertion. This
    pushes the handling of barrier calls into the OpenXR state tracker, while
    the changes are minimal for the client compositors they no longer have the
    responsibility to implicitly to insert a barrier when needed. Allows us to
    in the future support extensions.
    ([!1743](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1743))
  - Introduce `xrt_layer_frame_data` struct that holds per frame data for the
    `xrt_compositor` layer interface. This is a sibling to the `xrt_layer_data`
    struct which holds per layer data. Both are structs instead of arguments to
    make it easier to pass the needed data through the layers of Monado, and for
    easier extension further down the line.
    ([!1755](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/1755))
  - Extend `xrt_swapchain_create_properties` to allow the main compositor
    request extra bits to be used beyond those requested by the OpenXR app. Some
    compositors might need extra usage bits set beyond just the constant sampled
    bit. This also ensures that images have exactly the same usages in both the
    compositor and app.

    generic inputs.
    ([!2048](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/2048))

    a space has been used or no longer used. This allows for doing various things
    like recentering when an application starts, or stopping tracking of the floor
    if the stage or LOCAL_FLOOR space isn't used.

## Monado 21.0.0 (2021-01-28)

- Major changes
  - Adds a initial SteamVR driver state tracker and target that produces a SteamVR
    plugin that enables any Monado hardware driver to be used in SteamVR. This is
    the initial upstreaming of this code and has some limitations, like only having
    working input when emulating a Index controller.
    ([!583](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/583))
- XRT Interface
  - Add `xrt_binding_profile` struct, related pair structs and fields on
    `xrt_device` to allow to move the static rebinding of inputs and outputs into
    device drivers. This makes it easier to get a overview in the driver itself
    which bindings it can bind to.
    ([!587](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/587))
  - xrt: Generate bindings for Monado and SteamVR from json.
    ([!638](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/638))
  - xrt: Introduce `xrt_system_compositor`, it is basically a analogous to
    `XrSystemID` but instead of being a fully fledged xrt_system this is only the
    compositor part of it. Also fold the `prepare_session` function into the create
    native compositor function to simplify the interface.
    ([!652](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/652))
  - Expose more information on the frameservers, like product, manufacturer and
    serial.
    ([!665](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/665))
  - Add `XRT_FORMAT_BAYER_GR8` format.
    ([!665](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/665))
- State Trackers
  - st/oxr: Add OXR_FRAME_TIMING_SPEW for basic frame timing debug output.
    ([!591](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/591))
  - OpenXR: Make sure to restore old EGL display/context/drawables when creating a
    client EGL compositor.
    ([!602](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/602))
  - GUI: Expand with support for controlling the remote driver hand tracking.
    ([!604](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/604))
  - st/oxr: Implement XR_KHR_vulkan_enable2
    ([!633](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/633))
  - st/oxr: Add OXR_TRACKING_ORIGIN_OFFSET_{X,Y,Z} env variables as a quick way to
    tweak 6dof tracking origins.
    ([!634](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/634))
  - OpenXR: Be more relaxed with Quat validation, spec says within 1% of unit
    length, normalize if not within float epsilon.
    ([!659](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/659))
- Drivers
  - ns: Fix memory leak in math code.

  - psvr: Rename some variables for better readability.
    ([!597](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/597))
  - openhmd: Fix viewport calculation of rotated displays.
    ([!600](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/600))
  - remote: Add support for simulated hand tracking, this is based on the curl
    model
    that is used by the Valve Index Controller.
    ([!604](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/604))
  - android: Acquire device display metrics from system.
    ([!611](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/611))
  - openhmd: Rotate DK2 display correctly.
    ([!628](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/628))
  - d/psmv: The motor on zcmv1 does not rumble at amplitudes < 0.25. Linear rescale
    amplitude into [0.25, 1] range.
    ([!636](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/636))
  - v4l2: Expose more information through new fields in XRT interface.
    ([!665](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/665))
  - v4l2: Allocate more buffers when streaming data.
    ([!665](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/665))
- IPC
  - ipc: Port IPC to u_logging.
    ([!601](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/601))
  - ipc: Make OXR_DEBUG_GUI work with monado-service.
    ([!622](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/622))
- Compositor
  - comp: Add basic frame timing information to XRT_COMPOSITOR_LOG=trace.
    ([!591](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/591))
  - main: Refactor how the compositor interacts with targets, the goal is to enable
    the compositor to render to destinations that isn't backed by a `VkSwapchain`.
    Introduce `comp_target` and remove `comp_window`, also refactor `vk_swapchain`
    to be a sub-class of `comp_target` named `comp_target_swapchain`, the window
    backends now sub class `comp_target_swapchain`.
    ([!599](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/599))
  - Implement support for XR_KHR_composition_layer_equirect (equirect1).
    ([!620](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/620),
    [!624](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/624))
  - comp: Improve thread safety. Resolve issues in multithreading CTS.
    ([!645](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/645))
  - main: Lower priority on sRGB format. This works around a bug in the OpenXR CTS
    and mirrors better what at least on other OpenXR runtime does.
    ([!671](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/671))
- Helper Libraries
  - os/time: Make timespec argument const.
    ([!597](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/597))
  - os/time: Add a Linux specific way to get the realtime clock (for RealSense).
    ([!597](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/597))
  - math: Make sure that we do not drop and positions in poses when the other pose
    has a non-valid position.
    ([!603](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/603))
  - aux/vk: `vk_create_device` now takes in a list of Vulkan device extensions.
    ([!605](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/605))
  - Port everything to u_logging.
    ([!627](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/627))
  - u/hand_tracking: Tweak finger curl model making it easier to grip ingame
    objects.
    ([!635](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/635))
  - math: Add math_quat_validate_within_1_percent function.
    ([!659](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/659))
  - u/sink: Add Bayer format converter.
    ([!665](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/665))
  - u/distortion: Improve both Vive and Index distortion by fixing polynomial math.
    ([!666](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/666))
  - u/distortion: Improve Index distortion and tidy code. While this touches the
    Vive distortion code all Vive headsets seems to have the center set to the same
    for each channel so doesn't help them. And Vive doesn't have the extra
    coefficient that the Index does so no help there either.
    ([!667](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/667))

## Monado 0.4.1 (2020-11-04)

- State Trackers
  - st/oxr: Fix for new conformance tests for xrWaitFrame, xrBeginFrame,
    xrEndFrame call order. Also fix OpenXR state transition logic depending on a
    synchronized frame loop.
    ([!589](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/589),
    [!590](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/590))

## Monado 0.4.0 (2020-11-02)

- XRT Interface
  - add `xrt_device_type` to `xrt_device` to differentiate handed controllers
    from
    controllers that can be held in either hand.
    ([!412](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/412))
  - Rename functions and types that assumed the native graphics buffer handle type
    was an FD: in `auxiliary/vk/vk_helpers.{h,c}` `vk_create_image_from_fd` ->
    `vk_create_image_from_native`, in the XRT headers `struct xrt_compositor_fd` ->
    `xrt_compositor_native` (and method name changes from `xrt_comp_fd_...` ->
    `xrt_comp_native_...`), `struct xrt_swapchain_fd` -> `struct
    xrt_swapchain_native`, `struct xrt_image_fd` -> `struct xrt_image_native`, and
    corresponding parameter/member/variable name changes (e.g. `struct
    xrt_swapchain_fd *xscfd` becomes `struct xrt_swapchain_native *xscn`).
    ([!426](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/426),
    [!428](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/428))
  - Make some fields on `xrt_gl_swapchain` and `xrt_vk_swapchain` private moving
    them into the client compositor code instead of exposing them.
    ([!444](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/444))
  - Make `xrt_compositor::create_swapchain` return xrt_result_t instead of the
    swapchain, this makes the methods on `xrt_compositor` more uniform.
    ([!444](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/444))
  - Add the method `xrt_compositor::import_swapchain` allowing a state tracker to
    create a swapchain from a set of pre-allocated images. Uses the same
    `xrt_swapchain_create_info` as `xrt_compositor::create_swapchain`.
    ([!444](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/444))
  - Make `xrt_swapchain_create_flags` swapchain static image bit match OpenXR.
    ([!454](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/454))
  - Add `XRT_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT` flag to `xrt_swapchain_usage_bits`
    so that a client can create a Vulkan swapchain that can be used as input
    attachment.
    ([!459](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/459))
  - Remove the `flip_y` parameter to the creation of the native compositor, this
    is
    now a per layer thing.
    ([!461](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/461))
  - Add `xrt_compositor_info` struct that allows the compositor carry information
    to about its capabilities and its recommended values. Not everything is hooked
    up at the moment.
    ([!461](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/461))
  - Add defines for underlying handle types.
    ([!469](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/469))
  - Add a native handle type for graphics sync primitives (currently file
    descriptors on all platforms).
    ([!469](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/469))
  - Add a whole bunch of structs and functions for all of the different layers
    in
    OpenXR. The depth layer information only applies to the stereo projection
    so
    make a special stereo projection with depth layer.
    ([!476](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/476))
  - Add `xrt_image_native_allocator` as a friend to the compositor interface. This
    simple interface is intended to be used by the IPC interface to allocate
    `xrt_image_native` on the client side and send those to the service.
    ([!478](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/478))
  - Re-arrange and document `xrt_image_native`, making the `size` field optional.
    ([!493](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/493))
  - Add const to all compositor arguments that are info structs, making the
    interface safer and
    more clear. Also add `max_layers` field to the
    `xrt_compositor_info` struct.
    ([!501](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/501))
  - Add `xrt_space_graph` struct for calculating space relations. This struct and
    accompanying makes it easier to reason about space relations than just
    functions
    operating directly on `xrt_space_relation`. The code base is changed
    to use
    these new functions.
    ([!519](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/519))
  - Remove the `linear_acceleration` and `angular_acceleration` fields from the
    `xrt_space_relation` struct, these were not used in the codebase and are not
    exposed in the OpenXR API. They can easily be added back should they be
    required again by code or a future feature. Drivers are free to retain this
    information internally, but no longer expose it.
    ([!519](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/519))
  - Remove the `out_timestamp` argument to the `xrt_device::get_tracked_pose`
    function, it's not needed anymore and the devices can do prediction better
    as
    it knows more about its tracking system the the state tracker.
    ([!521](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/521))
  - Replace mesh generator with `compute_distortion` function on `xrt_device`. This
    is used to both make it possible to use mesh shaders for devices and to provide
    compatibility with SteamVR which requires a `compute_distortion` function as
    well.

    The compositor uses this function automatically to create a mesh and
    uses mesh
    distortion for all drivers. The function `compute_distortion` default
    implementations for `none`, `panotools` and `vive` distortion models are
    provided in util.
    ([!536](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/536))
  - Add a simple curl value based finger tracking model and use it for vive and
    survive controllers.
    ([!555](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/555))
- State Trackers
  - OpenXR: Add support for attaching Quad layers to action sapces.
    ([!437](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/437))
  - OpenXR: Use initial head pose as origin for local space.
    ([!443](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/443))
  - OpenXR: Minor fixes for various bits of code: copy-typo in device assignment
    code; better stub for the unimplemented function
    `xrEnumerateBoundSourcesForAction`; better error message on internal error in
    `xrGetCurrentInteractionProfile`.
    ([!448](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/448))
  - OpenXR: Make the `xrGetCurrentInteractionProfile` conformance tests pass,
    needed
    to implement better error checking as well as generating
    `XrEventDataInteractionProfileChanged` events to the client.
    ([!448](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/448))
  - OpenXR: Centralize all sub-action path iteration in some x-macros.
    ([!449](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/449),
    [!456](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/456))
  - OpenXR: Improve the validation in the API function for
    `xrGetInputSourceLocalizedName`.
    ([!451](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/451))
  - OpenXR: Implement the function `xrEnumerateBoundSourcesForAction`, currently we
    only bind one input per top level user path and it's easy to track this.
    ([!451](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/451))
  - OpenXR: Properly handle more than one input source being bound to the same
    action
    according to the combination rules of the specification.
    ([!452](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/452))
  - OpenXR: Fix multiplicity of bounds paths per action - there's one per
    input/output.
    ([!456](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/456))
  - OpenXR: Implement the MND_swapchain_usage_input_attachment_bit extension.
    ([!459](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/459))
  - OpenXR: Refactor the native compositor handling a bit, this creates the
    compositor earlier then before. This allows us to get the viewport information
    from it.
    ([!461](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/461))
  - OpenXR: Implement action set priorities and fix remaining action conformance
    tests.
    ([!462](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/462))
  - st/oxr: Fix crash when calling `xrPollEvents` when headless mode is selected.
    ([!475](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/475))
  - OpenXR: Add stub functions and support plumbing for a lot of layer extensions.
    ([!476](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/476))
  - OpenXR: Be sure to return `XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED` if the protected
    content bit is set and the compositor does not support it.
    ([!481](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/481))
  - OpenXR: Update to 1.0.11 and start returning the new
    `XR_ERROR_GRAPHICS_REQUIREMENTS_CALL_MISSING` code added in this release.
    ([!482](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/482))
  - OpenXR: Enable the `XR_KHR_android_create_instance` extension.
    ([!492](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/492))
  - OpenXR: Add support for creating swapchains with depth formats and submitting
    depth layers. The depth layers are passed through to the compositor, but are
    not used yet.
    ([!498](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/498))
  - OpenXR: For pose actions the any path (`XR_NULL_PATH`) needs to be special
    cased, essentially turning into a separate action sub path, that is assigned
    at
    binding time.
    ([!510](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/510))
  - OpenXR: More correctly implement `xrGetInputSourceLocalizedName` allowing apps
    to more accurently tell the user which input to use.
    ([!532](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/532))
  - OpenXR: Pass through equirect layer data to the compositor.
    ([!566](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/566))
- Drivers
  - psvr: We were sending in the wrong type of time to the 3DOF fusion code,
    switch
    to nanoseconds instead of fractions of seconds.
    ([!474](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/474))
  - rs: Make the pose getting from the T265 be threaded. Before we where getting
    the
    pose from the update input function, this would cause some the main thread
    to
    block and would therefore cause jitter in the rendering.
    ([!486](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/486))
  - survive: Add lighthouse tracking system type
    hydra: Add lighthouse tracking
    system type
    ([!489](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/489))
  - rs: Add slam tracking system type
    northstar: Use tracking system from tracker
    (e.g. rs) if available.

    follow the spec more closely. The aim poses replaces the previous ball tip pose
    that was used before for aim.

    might be solvable by using `SOCK_SEQPACKET`.
    ([!444](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/444))
  - Implement the `xrt_compositor::import_swapchain` function, uses the earlier
    `in_handle` work.
    ([!444](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/444))

  - client: Implement the usage of the `xrt_image_native_allocator`, currently not
    used. But it is needed for platforms where for various reasons the allocation
    must happen on the client side.
    ([!478](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/478))
  - client: Add a "loopback" image allocator, this code allocates a swapchain from
    the service then imports that back to the service as if it was imported. This
    tests both the import code and the image allocator code.

## Monado 0.3.0 (2020-07-10)

- Major changes
  - Centralise the logging functionality in Monado to a single util helper.
    Previously most of our logging was done via fprints and gated behind booleans,
    now there are common functions to call and a predefined set of levels.
    ([!408](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/408),
    [!409](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/409))
- XRT Interface
  - compositor: Remove the `array_size` field from the struct, this was the only
    state tracker supplied value that was on the struct, only have values that the
    compositor decides over on the struct.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - Improve Doxygen documentation of interfaces. Now the inheritance structure and
    implementation of interfaces is shown in the docs, and helper functions that
    call through function pointers are listed as "member functions", to help
    developers understand the internal structure of Monado better.
    ([!365](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/365),
    [!367](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/367))
  - xrt: Add xrt_result_t return type to many compositor functions that previously
    had no way to indicate failure.
    ([!369](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/369))
  - compositor: Introduce `xrt_swapchain_create_info` simplifying the argument
    passing between various layers of the compositor stack and also simplify future
    refactoring projects.
    ([!407](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/407))
- State Trackers
  - OpenXR: Update headers to 1.0.9.
    ([!358](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/358))
  - OpenXR: Verify that the XrViewConfigurationType is supported by the system as
    required by the OpenXR spec in xrEnumerateEnvironmentBlendModes.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Return the correct error code when verifying the sub action, if it is
    a
    valid sub action path but not given at action creation we should return
    `XR_ERROR_PATH_UNSUPPORTED`.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Validate the subImage data for both projection and quad layers layers,
    refactor code out so it can be shared with the different types of layers. Need
    to track some state on the `oxr_swapchain` in order to do the checking.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Correct the return error code for action and action set localized name
    validation.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Correct the error messages on sub action paths errors.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Track the name and localized name for both actions and action sets,
    that
    way we can make sure that there are no duplicates. This is required by the
    spec. ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Do better checking if action sets and actions have been attached to the
    session or not.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Validate the arguments for `xrSuggestInteractionProfileBindings` better
    so that it follows the spec better.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Rework the logging formatting of error messages, this makes it easier
    to
    read for the application developer.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Correctly ensure that the application has called the required get
    graphics requirements function when creating a session.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: When an `XrSession` is destroyed purge the event queue of any events
    that
    references to it so that no events gets delivered to the applications with
    stales handles.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Make the event queue thread safe, all done with a simple mutex that is
    not held for long at all.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: A major overhaul of the swapchain acquire, wait and release code. This
    makes it almost completely conformant with the spec. Tricky parts include that
    multiple images can be acquired, but only one can be waited on before being
    released.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Enforce that static swapchains can only be acquired once, this is
    required by the spec and make sure that a image is only rendered to once, and
    allows the runtime to perform special optimizations on the image.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Make the function `xrGetReferenceSpaceBoundsRect` at least conform to
    the spec without actually implementing it, currently we do not track bounds in
    Monado.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Make the session state changes obey the specification. The code is
    fairly hair as is and should be improved at a later time.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Use the correct XrPath for `/user/gamepad` while it sits in the users
    hand itsn't `/user/hand/gamepad` as previously believed.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - OpenXR: Where used make sure we verify the view configuration type is a valid
    enum value, the code is setup so that we in the future can support new values
    via extensions easily.
    ([!368](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/368))
  - OpenXR: More correctly verify the interactive profile binding data, including
    the given interactive profile is correct and the binding point is valid.
    ([!377](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/377))
  - OpenXR: Transform input types in a somewhat flexible, composable way. Also, do
    conversion at sync time, and use the transformed values to evaluate if the
    input has changed, per the spec.
    ([!379](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/379))
  - OpenXR: Tidy the extensions generated by the script and order them according
    to
    extension prefix, starting with KHR, EXT, Vendor, KHRX, EXTX, VendorX. Also
    rename the `MND_ball_on_stick_controller` to `MNDX_ball_on_a_stick_controller`.
    ([!410](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/410))
  - OpenXR: Fix overly attached action sets, which would appear to be attached to
    a
    session even after the session has been destroyed. Also tidy up comments and
    other logic surrounding this.
    ([!411](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/411))
- Drivers
  - psvr: Normalize the rotation to not trip up the client app when it gives the
    rotation back to `st/oxr` again.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - vive: Create vive_config module to isolate config code and avoid duplication
    between controller and headset code.
    vive: Probe for controllers in vive_proper
    interface.
    vive: Fix a bug where using the Vive Pro crashed Monado.
    vive: Fix a
    bug where the controller didn't parse JSON vectors correctly.
    vive: Move
    missing functions to and use u_json.
    ([!405](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/405))
  - vive: Add support for Gen1 and Gen2 Vive Trackers.
    ([!406](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/406))
  - vive: Port to new u_logging API.
    ([!417](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/417))
  - comp: Set a compositor window title.
    ([!418](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/418))
- IPC
  - server: Almost completely overhaul the handling of swapchain lifecycle
    including: correctly track which swapchains are alive; reuse ids; enforce the
    maximum number of swapchains; and destroy underlying swapchains when they are
    destroyed by the client.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - util: Make sure to not dereference NULL control messages, say in the case of the
    server failing to create a swapchain. Also add a whole bunch of paranoia when
    it comes to the alignment of the control message buffers.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - ipc: Return XR_ERROR_INSTANCE_LOST on IPC errors.
    ([!369](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/369))
- Compositor
  - main: Include `<math.h>` in layers renderer for missing `tanf` function.
    ([!358](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/358))
  - swapchain: Give out the oldset image index when a image is acquired. This logic
    can be made better, but will work for the good case.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - swapchain: Close any FDs that are still valid, for instance the ipc server
    copies the FDs to the client.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - client: When we give a image fd to the either OpenGL or Vulkan it is consumed
    and cannot be reused. So make sure that it is set to an invalid fd value on the
    `xrt_image_fd` on the owning `xrt_swapchain_fd`.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - main: We were alpha blending all layers previously, but now we support the
    layer flag that OpenXR gives us. We do this by using different `VkImageView`s
    with different component swizzles.
    ([!394](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/394))
  - layer_rendering: Use the visibility flags on quad to correctly show the layers
    in each eye.
    ([!394](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/394))
- Helper Libraries
  - os/threading: Include `xrt_compiler.h` to fix missing stdint types.
    ([!358](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/358))
  - util: Add a very simple fifo for indices, this is used to keep track of
    swapchain in order of age (oldness).
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))
  - util: Expand `u_hashset` to be able to automatically allocate a `u_hashet_item`
    and insert it.
    ([!359](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/359))

## Monado 0.2 (2020-05-29)

- Major changes
  - Add support for a new service process. This process houses the hardware drivers
    and compositor. In order to do this, a whole new subsection of Monado called
    ipc
    was added. It lives in `src/xrt/ipc` and sits between the state trackers
    and
    the service hosting the drivers and compositor.
    ([!295](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/295))
  - Support optional systemd socket-activation: if not disabled at configure time,
    `monado-service` can be launched by systemd as a service with an associated
    socket. If the service is launched this way, it will use the systemd-created
    domain socket instead of creating its own. (If launched manually, it will still
    create its own as normal.) This allows optional auto-launching of the service
    when running a client (OpenXR) application. Associated systemd unit files are
    also included.
    ([!306](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/306))
- XRT Interface
  - Add a new settings interface for transporting camera settings, in
    `xrt/xrt_settings.h`.
    ([!266](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/266))
  - Make it possible to send JSON object to drivers when probing for devices.
    ([!266](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/266))
  - Added new `xrt_instance` object to be root object, a singleton that allows us
    to
    better swap out the whole stack underneath the state trackers. This is now
    implemented by the `xrt_prober` code and used by the OpenXR state tracker.
    ([!274](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/274))
  - Remove the `struct timestate` argument from the `struct xrt_device` interface.
    It should be easy to write a driver and the state tracker should be the one
    that tracks this state. It was mostly triggered by the out of process
    compositor work.
    ([!280](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/280))
  - Add the new format `XRT_FORMAT_UYVY422` to the interface and various parts of
    the code where it is needed to be supported, like the conversion functions and
    calibration code. Also rename the `XRT_FORMAT_YUV422` to `XRT_FORMAT_YUYV422`.
    ([!283](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/283))
  - Expose manufacturer and serial number in the prober interface, right now only
    for the video device probing. But this is the only thing that really requires
    this in order to tell different cameras apart.
    ([!286](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/286))
  - Add `XRT_CAST_PTR_TO_OXR_HANDLE` and `XRT_CAST_OXR_HANDLE_TO_PTR` macros to
    perform warning-free conversion between pointers and OpenXR handles, even on
    32-bit platforms. They should be used instead of raw casts.
    ([!294](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/294))
  - Remove declaration and implementations of `xrt_prober_create`: the minimal
    functionality previously performed there should now be moved to
    `xrt_instance_create`.
    ([!347](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/347))
- State Trackers
  - gui: Fix compilation issue in `st/gui` when building without OpenCV.

    allows swapchains to be destroyed from other threads.
    ([!278](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/278))

    ([!282](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/282))
  - u/time: Temporarily disable the time skew in time state and used fixed offset
    instead to fix various time issues in `st/oxr`. Will be fixed properly later.
    ([!348](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/348))
  - math: Correctly validate quaternion using non-squared "length" instead of
    squared "length", certain combinations of elements would produce valid regular
    "length" but not valid squared ones.
    ([!350](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/350))
- Misc. Features

  - util: Add some bit manipulation helper functions in `util/u_bitwise.c` and
    `util/u_bitwise.c`.
    ([!242](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/242))
  - tracking: Make stereo_camera_calibration reference counted, and have the
    prober,
    not the calibration, call the save function.
    ([!245](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/245))
  - math: Expand algebraic math functions in `math/m_api.h`, `math/m_vec3.h` and

    ([!284](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/284),
    [#62](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/issues/62))
  - ci: Perform test builds using the Android NDK (for armeabi-v7a and armv8-a).
    This is not a full Android port (missing a compositor, etc) but it ensures we
    don't add more Android porting problems.
    ([!292](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/292))
- Misc. Fixes
  - os/ble: Check if `org.bluez` name is available before calling in
    `os/os_ble_dbus.c`.
    ([#65](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/issues/65),
    [#64](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/issues/64),
    [!265](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/265))
  - README: Added information to the README containing OpenHMD version requirement
    and information regarding the requirement of `GL_EXT_memory_object_fd` and
    limitations on Monado's compositor.
    ([!4](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/4))
  - build: Fix build issues and build warnings when 32-bit.
    ([!230](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/230))

    ([!264](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/264))
  - os/ble: Make ble code check for some error returns in `os/os_ble_dbus.c`.
    ([!265](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/265))

    ([!284](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/284))
  - build: Mark OpenXR runtime target in CMake as a MODULE library, instead of a
    SHARED library.
    ([!284](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/284))
  - windows: Way way back when Gallium was made `auxiliary` was named `aux` but
    then
    it was ported to Windows and it was renamed to `auxiliary` since Windows
    is [allergic to filenames that match its device names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions)
    (e.g., `AUX`, `CON`, `PRN`, etc.). Through the ages, this knowledge was lost
    and so we find ourselves with the same problem. Although Monado inherited
    the correct name, the same old mistake was made in docs.
    ([!314](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/314))
  - build: For CMake rename (nearly) all build options so they begin with `XRT_`
    and match the defines used in the source. You will probably want to clear
    your build directory and reconfigure from scratch.
    ([!327](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/327))
  - ipc: Correctly set the shared semaphore value when creating it, the wrong value
    resulted in the client not blocking in `xrWaitFrame`.
    ([!348](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/merge_requests/348))
  - ipc: Previously some arguments where dropped at swapchain creation time,
    correct pass them between the client and server.
